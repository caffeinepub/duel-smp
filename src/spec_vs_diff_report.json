  "summary": "Diff adds a global, user-facing initialization/query error banner in the AppLayout and introduces Vite env typings, but does not show any changes to build/deployment workflow configuration or the required static asset files under frontend/public.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Investigate and fix the current build/deployment workflow so that a build actually starts when triggered and completes successfully for the current codebase (including clear failure output).",
      "reason": "The diff only shows frontend component/hook/type additions and an AppLayout change; there is no evidence of changes to deployment/build pipeline configuration (e.g., CI/CD, scripts, dfx config) or logging/error surfacing for build failures.",
      "evidence": [
        "<file-diff>: only frontend files added/modified (frontend/src/components/*, frontend/src/hooks/*, frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts)"

      "reason": "AppLayout references the banner/logo paths, but the diff does not include any added/modified files under frontend/public/assets/generated, so there is no evidence the required images were added or verified to exist.",
